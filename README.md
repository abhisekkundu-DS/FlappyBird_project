# Flappy Bird - Java Edition 🎮🐦

## 📌 Description
Flappy Bird - Java Edition is a simple yet engaging **arcade-style game** developed using **Java** with **AWT and Swing** for graphical rendering. The objective is to control a bird, making it **flap** through gaps between two vertically aligned pipes while avoiding collisions. The game includes basic physics to simulate gravity, as well as a scoring system that rewards players for successfully passing pipes.

Designed with a **lightweight approach**, this game showcases fundamental game mechanics like event-driven programming, object-oriented design, and graphical user interface components using **Swing**.

## 🚀 Features
✔️ **Classic Flappy Bird-style gameplay** – easy to play, but hard to master  
✔️ **Procedurally generated pipes** – ensuring dynamic play and varied difficulty  
✔️ **Realistic gravity simulation** – creating a natural falling movement  
✔️ **Collision detection** – for pipe and ground collisions  
✔️ **Score tracking system** – rewarding players based on pipe passes  
✔️ **Game Over screen** – to reset and try again  
✔️ **Smooth Java AWT & Swing rendering** – optimized for performance  

## 🎮 Gameplay Mechanics
- The player controls the bird using the **space bar or mouse clicks** to make it flap.
- Each flap raises the bird; otherwise, it is pulled downward due to gravity.
- The pipes continuously scroll from **right to left**, creating a moving obstacle challenge.
- The **collision detection system** ensures the game resets when the bird hits an obstacle.
- The score increases **each time the bird successfully passes between the pipes**.
